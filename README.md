# Ansible-Project-1
Ansible was utilized to automate the configuration backup process for multiple Cisco network devices. A designated inventory group was created to manage a router and two switches, allowing their running configurations to be systematically retrieved and stored using a timestamped naming convention for both folders and files.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to demonstrate effective network automation by leveraging Ansible to manage and interact with Cisco IOS devices. The target network included a Cisco 1900 router and two switches, configured with the IP addresses 192.168.125.1, 192.168.125.7, and 192.168.125.8. A custom Ansible playbook was developed to connect to each device, retrieve its hostname and full running configuration, and save the output locally within a timestamped directory structure. This solution ensures reliable, consistent backups and contributes to scalable network configuration management and disaster recovery preparedness.

## Key Requirements
- SSH Enabled on Devices: All Cisco routers and switches must have SSH access configured to allow Ansible to connect and execute commands remotely.
- IP Address Configuration: Each network device is assigned a static IP address to ensure consistent connectivity (e.g., 192.168.125.1, 192.168.125.7, 192.168.125.8).
- Physical Connectivity: Devices must be physically connected to the network and powered on to respond to SSH requests during backup execution.
- Network Reachability: The Ansible control node must be able to reach each device over the network (verified using ping or ssh).
- Ansible Control Node: A dedicated host machine (Ubuntu-based) with Ansible installed is required to execute the playbook and manage devices.
- VirtualBox Bridged Adapter: The Ansible control node runs inside a VirtualBox virtual machine configured with a bridged network adapter, enabling it to operate on the same LAN as the physical Cisco devices.

### 📁 Ansible Inventory (`inventory.ini`)

```ini
# Define the group of Cisco network devices
[cisco_devices]
ROUTER-1 ansible_host=192.168.125.1  # Cisco 1900 router
SWITCH-1 ansible_host=192.168.125.2  # Cisco switch 1
SWITCH-2 ansible_host=192.168.125.3  # Cisco switch 2

# Group variables applied to all devices in [cisco_devices]
[cisco_devices:vars]
ansible_user=cisco                      # SSH username
ansible_password=cisco                  # SSH password
ansible_port=22                         # Default SSH port
ansible_become=yes                      # Enable privilege escalation
ansible_become_method=enable            # Use 'enable' mode for Cisco devices
ansible_become_password=cisco           # Password for enable mode
ansible_network_os=cisco.ios.ios        # Specify Cisco IOS network OS plugin
ansible_connection=network_cli          # Use CLI connection for network devices
```

### 📄 Ansible Playbook: `backup_playbook.yml`

```yaml
---
- name: Backup Cisco Device Configurations
  hosts: cisco_devices          # Target group of Cisco devices defined in the inventory
  gather_facts: no              # Skip fact gathering (not needed for network devices)
  vars:
    backup_base_dir: "{{ playbook_dir }}/backups"  # Base directory for storing backups

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Generate timestamp (run once on localhost)
      delegate_to: localhost
      run_once: true
      set_fact:
        global_timestamp: "{{ lookup('pipe', 'date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S') }}"  # Get current date/time

    - name: Set shared backup directory path
      set_fact:
        backup_dir: "{{ backup_base_dir }}/{{ global_timestamp }}"  # Full backup directory path with timestamp

  tasks:
    - name: Create local backup directory (once for all backups)
      delegate_to: localhost
      run_once: true
      file:
        path: "{{ backup_dir }}"   # Create the backup directory locally
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Get device hostname
      ios_command:
        commands: "show running-config | include ^hostname"  # Fetch the hostname from running config
      register: hostname_output

    - name: Extract hostname
      set_fact:
        device_hostname: "{{ hostname_output.stdout[0].split(' ')[1] }}"  # Parse hostname from command output

    - name: Backup running config
      ios_command:
        commands: "show running-config"  # Retrieve full running configuration
      register: running_config

    - name: Ensure backup directory exists on localhost
      delegate_to: localhost
      file:
        path: "{{ backup_dir }}"  # Double-check directory exists before saving files
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Save config to file
      delegate_to: localhost
      copy:
        content: "{{ running_config.stdout[0] }}"  # Save config content to file
        dest: "{{ backup_dir }}/{{ device_hostname }}_{{ global_timestamp }}.cfg"  # Filename includes hostname and timestamp
```

### Outcome
The successful implementation of Ansible for network automation on a Cisco 1900 router showcased the potential for efficient network management and configuration retrieval. This project highlighted my ability to set up and configure automation tools, troubleshoot network connectivity, and manage network devices programmatically.
