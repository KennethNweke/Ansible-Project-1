# Ansible-Project-1
Ansible was utilized to automate the configuration backup process for multiple Cisco network devices. A designated inventory group was created to manage a router and two switches, allowing their running configurations to be systematically retrieved and stored using a timestamped naming convention for both folders and files.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to demonstrate effective network automation by leveraging Ansible to manage and interact with Cisco IOS devices. The target network included a Cisco 1900 router and two switches, configured with the IP addresses 192.168.125.1, 192.168.125.7, and 192.168.125.8. A custom Ansible playbook was developed to connect to each device, retrieve its hostname and full running configuration, and save the output locally within a timestamped directory structure. This solution ensures reliable, consistent backups and contributes to scalable network configuration management and disaster recovery preparedness.

## Key Requirements
- SSH Enabled on Devices: All Cisco routers and switches must have SSH access configured to allow Ansible to connect and execute commands remotely.
- IP Address Configuration: Each network device is assigned a static IP address to ensure consistent connectivity (e.g., 192.168.125.1, 192.168.125.7, 192.168.125.8).
- Physical Connectivity: Devices must be physically connected to the network and powered on to respond to SSH requests during backup execution.
- Network Reachability: The Ansible control node must be able to reach each device over the network (verified using ping or ssh).
- Ansible Control Node: A dedicated host machine (Ubuntu-based) with Ansible installed is required to execute the playbook and manage devices.
- VirtualBox Bridged Adapter: The Ansible control node runs inside a VirtualBox virtual machine configured with a bridged network adapter, enabling it to operate on the same LAN as the physical Cisco devices.

### üìÅ Ansible Inventory (`inventory.ini`)

```ini
# Define the group of Cisco network devices
[cisco_devices]
ROUTER-1 ansible_host=192.168.125.1  # Cisco 1900 router
SWITCH-1 ansible_host=192.168.125.2  # Cisco switch 1
SWITCH-2 ansible_host=192.168.125.3  # Cisco switch 2

# Group variables applied to all devices in [cisco_devices]
[cisco_devices:vars]
ansible_user=cisco                      # SSH username
ansible_password=cisco                  # SSH password
ansible_port=22                         # Default SSH port
ansible_become=yes                      # Enable privilege escalation
ansible_become_method=enable            # Use 'enable' mode for Cisco devices
ansible_become_password=cisco           # Password for enable mode
ansible_network_os=cisco.ios.ios        # Specify Cisco IOS network OS plugin
ansible_connection=network_cli          # Use CLI connection for network devices
```
